## Two Pairs of Animals

---
This is a simple memory game; in this memory game the goal is to make as many pairs of cards as possible by turning over cards with the same picture.

To make the game more difficult you can choose a different level. You can choose from the following levels:
*   Easy    - 2x4
*   Med     - 3x4
*   Hard    - 4x4

The images I use are of different animals.

Instructions of the game:
You can start by turning the cards over. 
Remember the locations of the cards and make pairs of 2 of the same cards
You can increase the number of cards and the difficulty in the top left corner.                
By choosing EASY, MED and HARD. 
Good Luck!

## User Experience (UX)

**User Story**

User’s goal:
* As a user, I want to play an easy and simple game 
* As a user, I want an easy navigate website
* As a user, I want to have different levels to better my skills
* As a user, I want to see a timer on the page, so I can see how much time I have been playing.

Site owner’s Goal:
* As the site owner, I want the user to have an easily accessible site.
* As the site owner, I want the user to have fun with this game

**Strategy**

I wanted to make a simple and above all easy game.
You can play it at home but also when you are on the road. The game is fun for everyone whether they are young or old.

**Scope**

The goal for me was that I have a user-friendly, simple and gentle on the eyes game. With simple colors such as black, gray and white.

**Structure**

The structure of this game is divided over three pages, on the homepage, where the game starts right with the level of EASY.
On all pages, at the top left corner you can find the different levels that can be played. Consisting of EASY-MED and -HARD.
You will also find a pop-up button on each page with instructions of the game. Next to this button is the Reset button. This allows you to shuffle the cards again and start a new game.

**Skeleton**

For the user stories I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create a nice and simple layout for the desktop and mobile screen.
Links to the wireframes can be found here:

*   [Desktop wireframe](readme-documents/wireframe-desktop.png)
*   [Tablet wireframe](readme-documents/wireframe-tablet.png)
*   [Mobile wireframe](readme-documents/wireframe-mobile.png)

**Surface**

For the images I used random animal pictures made by different photographers.

#### Features Left to Implement

Due to lack of time, I didn't get around to adding the following features to this game. But I hope to implement the following points in the near future.

*   Submitting a name: This way you can add your name to the game and compete with your friends.
*   Score Board: So, users can see where they are ranked when they play against each other and for the possibility to see their score.
*   Even more difficult levels to the game to challenge yourself or your friend.
