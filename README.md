## Memory Game
---
This is a simple memory game; in this memory game the goal is to make as many pairs of cards as possible by turning over cards with the same picture.

To make the game more difficult you can choose a different level. You can choose from the following levels:
*   Easy	- 2x4
*   Med	    - 3x4
*   Hard	- 4x4

The images I use are of different animals.

Instructions of the game:
You can start by turning the cards over. 
Remember the locations of the cards and make pairs of 2 of the same cards
You can increase the number of cards and the difficulty in the top left corner.                
By choosing EASY, MED and HARD. 
Good Luck!

During this process I modified the website several times and it doesn't look quite the same as the wireframes.

**[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**
-   I've used Google Fonts to select the font for my website.

**[Pexels](https://pexels.com/)**
-   I've used photos from various photographers who posted photos on pexels.com. All the names of the photographers are listed in the media section below this page.

-  For the color selection I've used adobe color. [Click here](assets/readme-docs/adobe-color.jpg) to see the color pallet.
