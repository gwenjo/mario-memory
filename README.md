## Welcome to Infintiy Gym
---
[live version of Infinity Gym](https://gwenjo.github.io/MS1-infinity-gym/) 


Infinity Gym is a fictional gym. I set this up gym for my MS1 project

The purpose of the Infinity Gym site and his content has been created to increase the customer base.
Infinity Gym is a gym and fitness center, this gym is open for about two months. The gym is located in Almere Poort 
about 20 minutes from Amsterdam (The Netherlands). The gym has four rooms, two empty rooms for group lessons, 
a spinning room and an extensive fitness room. The guests can therefore enjoy a good workout and / or (group) lessons here.

## User Experience (UX)
---

<img src="assets/documents/mockup.jpg">

Infinity Gym would like to increase its customer base through a free first month promotion.
User Story

User’s goal:
* As a user, I want to know which lessons are available in the gym.
* As a user, I want to know the class timetable so that I can plan my workout routine around my favorite lesson.
* As a user, I want to view the gym’s contact information so that I can ask about the membership.
* As a user, I want to be able to locate the gym.

Site owner’s Goal:
* As the site owner, I want the user to have an easily accessible site.
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors of the class timetables.
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors the location of the gym.

## Wireframes   
---
With the user stories I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create a nice and simple layout for the desktop and mobile screen.

The wireframes: 
*   Home/ about page
*   Lessons page
*   Timetable page and
*   Locations page can be viewed [here](assets/documents/wireframes.pdf)

## Setup
---
When I started on this project I already knew what I wanted. A simple website where everything is clear.
Since I wanted to do everything perfectly in my head, I started over more than three times.
I've been working on multiple screens and got confused and forgot to save the pages in "git add". So, I couldn't save it after a while.

After talking to my mentor, she told me I only committed 11 times. This was not my intention, but my own mistake. 
I was able to restore my gitpod after saving everything, then clearing all .html pages, then committed + pushing everything, then 
creating new .html pages. 

That way I could commit everything again. Therefore, there is probably not enough committed pages.

#### About commit messages
At first I struggled with commit messages to keep it short and concise, but over time I think I've improved.

## Features
---
###### Navigationbar:
Each page has a navigation bar that contains all links to every page on the website. The -home, -lessons, -timetable and -location page. 
This is located at the top right of the page. Users can easily navigate through this. On the upper left side u will find the name of the gym.

###### Header:
All pages contain the logo of the gym and a "Call us" button, which displays the gym's number when you click on it.

###### Footer:
Each page also has a footer with contact details, opening times, a download button where users can download and / or print the timetable  
and three social media links that give all users access to our social media platforms on a separate page.

#### Existing Features

###### Home-Page:
The "about" is a brief introduction of the gym and where is located.
Below the about section there are two reviews that are displayed by guests (with their pictures) who are new to the gym and want to share 
their experiences with new users.

###### Lessons-Page:
On this page you will find information about the lessons within Infinity Gym. Under the information of the lessons there is a button that 
refers to the timetable.

###### Timetable-Page:
A simple and clear timetable has been created where the user can easily find his or her class. The timetable provides a weekly timetable 
with information about the times and locations where classes are conducted. It is also indicated how many people can participate in the 
lessons due to Covid-19.

###### Location-Page:
The location page is easy to find via the navigation bar. On this page you will find the address and a small map of the location.

#### Features Left to Implement

For the future of the website, it would be easy to create a contact form. Interested parties
can then leave their e-mail address and on this basis the customer list can be expanded.

## Technologies Used
---

* Github
* Gitpod
* HTML5 
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4.5.3

### Tools used
---

**[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)**
-   Before I started the website I used the Balsamiq software to set up my wireframe. <br>
During this process I modified the website several times and it doesn't look quite the same as the wireframes.

**[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**
-   i've used Google Fonts to selectthe font for my website.

**[PicCollage](https://piccollage.com/)**
-   I made the logo myself. For the Logo I have used an app on my Iphone. So that I could type the name 
(Infinity Gym) and easily crop my logo.

**[Pexels](https://pexels.com/)**
-   I've used photos from various photographers who posted photos on pexels.

**[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/nl/create/color-wheel)**
-   For the font-color I used Adobe Color. [Click here](assets/documents/adobe-color.jpg)

**[W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) + [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**
-   The first tietable I made was from W3School. but I didn't like the outcome of the table. 
    Then I continued my search and found one on Bootstrap.
-   For the quotes I used blockquotes from W3School.

**[Css Beautifier](https://www.freeformatter.com/css-beautifier.html)**
-   I used this online tool to beautify/format my CSS code.

**[Am I Responsive Design](http://ami.responsivedesign.is)**
-   For my mockup in my readme file i used Am I Responsive Design.

**[Auto-Prefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io)**
-   I used auto-prefixer to make sure my CSS works on all modern browsers.

**[W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)**
-   I used this tool to validate my HTML code.

**[W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**
-    I used this tool to validate my CSS code.

**[Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)**
-   I used dillenger for my readme file.

**[Wave Webaim](https://wave.webaim.org/)**
I used webaim to check the color contrast of my website.

### Typography

For the typography I have used the Roboto font with a backup font of Sans-serif. It is a simple and easy to read font.
The font is also easy to read on smaller devices.

### Color
I used adobe color scheme for choosing the colors of my website.

<img src="assets/documents/adobe-color.jpg" width="60%" height="60%">

Body text: #432d54

Title of the gym: #948eb7

Footer: #948eb7

Btn hover: #purple

When I was almost finished with my website. My mentor told me that my color contrasts weren't quite right in my headers, buttons, and footers.
I ran my website through [Wave Webaim](https://wave.webaim.org/) to see what the errors were. So I had to adjust the colors to get the right contrasts
for my website.

I've used a darker color #514C76 for my buttons with a font color #fafafa.
For my jumbotron message i had to mark the message and color it #585555 to give it a better contrast and to see it more clearly.

Footer has the same color as the buttons color #514C76 the font color is #fafafa.

For the download link and the media icons i used a light pink color #DB7093. however, when I run it through the webaim it still returns it as an error, 
i'm aware of it and i will fix this ussue in the future.

## Testing
---
#### W3C URL Validator
When I first passed my site through the validation, it revealed 3 errors, 

<img src="assets/testing/validator.jpg" width="60%" height="60%">

1.	I changed a < p > to a < h6 >
2.	I changed the btn names on all pages.

#### Lighthouse

<img src="assets/testing/lighthouse-desktop.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
<img src="assets/testing/lighthouse-mobile.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">

After testing the response from the lighthouse, it turned out that my photos were on the large side. However, this is not very bad for the desktop version, but for the mobile devices the average response is immediately reduced.

I have adjusted these pictures for all pages but the response from the lighthouse for the mobile version seems to be the same. I am aware that the mobile version of the lighthouse does not have a high score and hope to change 
this in the future. I am more than satisfied with the score of the lighthouse desktop version.
