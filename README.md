**[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)**

During this process I modified the website several times and it doesn't look quite the same as the wireframes.

**[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**
-   I've used Google Fonts to select the font for my website.

**[Pexels](https://pexels.com/)**
-   I've used photos from various photographers who posted photos on pexels.com. All the names of the fotographers are listed 
    in the media section below this page.

**[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/nl/create/color-wheel)**
-  For the color selection i've used adobe color. [Click here](assets/readme-docs/adobe-color.jpg) to see the colorpalet.

**[W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) + [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**

### Typography

For the typography I have used the Yusei Magic font with a backup font of Sans-serif. It is a nice and easy to read font.
The font is also easy to read on smaller devices.
